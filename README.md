# üìù TodoApp ‚Äî ASP.NET Core 8 MVC Todo Manager

A simple Todo Management web application built using **ASP.NET Core 8 MVC**, **Entity Framework Core**, and **SQLite**.  
This project is focused on clean structure, basic CRUD operations, and demonstrates a working knowledge of .NET Core MVC concepts.

## üöÄ Tech Stack

- [.NET 8 (ASP.NET Core MVC)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)
- [Entity Framework Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/) with SQLite
- [Bootstrap (via CDN)](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Swagger / Swashbuckle](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore) for API documentation

## üìÅ Project Folder Structure

The project is organized into key folders and files as follows:

- `Controllers/`
  - `TodosController.cs`: Handles the MVC web views for managing todos.
  - `TodosApiController.cs`: Provides RESTful API endpoints for external integration.
  
- `Models/`
  - `Todo.cs`: The Todo entity with fields like Title, Description, Status, etc.
  - `TodoStatus.cs`, `TodoPriority.cs`: Enums for the status and priority of a task.

- `Data/`
  - `AppDbContext.cs`: Entity Framework Core context class used to interact with the database.

- `Views/`
  - `Todos/`: Contains Razor views (Create, Edit, Delete, Details, Index) for managing todos through the browser.

- `wwwroot/`
  - Static content such as CSS, JS, and Bootstrap resources.

- `Program.cs`
  - Configures services, middleware, Swagger UI, and runs the application.

- `README.md`
  - This documentation file.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)
- Visual Studio 2022+ or VS Code
- Git

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GaMInST/Todo-Management-Application.git
cd Todo-Management-Application
```
### Restore & Run
```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet ef database update
dotnet run
```
Open your browser and navigate to:
üëâ https://localhost:5001 or http://localhost:5000
or `https://localhost:7272` (or the port shown in your browser when running from Visual Studio)

### Features Implemented
‚úÖ Basic CRUD for Todos
‚úÖ SQLite database with EF Core
‚úÖ Swagger API documentation (/swagger)
‚úÖ Server-side validation
‚úÖ MVC Views for Create/Edit/Delete/Details
‚úÖ Proper error handling
‚úÖ Clean code organization
‚úÖ Bootstrap UI via layout
‚úÖ Enum values rendered as dropdown in forms

## üìò API Documentation with Swagger

This project includes a Web API alongside the MVC views to allow interaction with Todo items programmatically.

### üîó Accessing Swagger

After running the project (via Visual Studio), open your browser and go to: 
``` https://localhost:7272/swagger```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Make sure the app is running in **HTTPS mode** as `https://localhost:7272`.

### üìÇ Available API Endpoints

A separate API controller (`TodosApiController`) has been added to provide JSON-based endpoints for working with Todos. You can use Swagger UI or Postman to interact with the following endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint                  | Description             |
|--------|---------------------------|-------------------------|
| GET    | /api/TodosApi             | Get all todos           |
| GET    | /api/TodosApi/{id}        | Get a specific todo     |
| POST   | /api/TodosApi             | Create a new todo       |
| PUT    | /api/TodosApi/{id}        | Update an existing todo |
| DELETE | /api/TodosApi/{id}        | Delete a todo           |

---

### üß™ Testing the API

You can test the API in two ways:

#### ‚úÖ Swagger UI
Visit: `https://localhost:7272/swagger`  
Try each operation directly from your browser.

#### ‚úÖ Postman
Use the above routes (e.g., `GET https://localhost:7272/api/TodosApi`) to test the API.

---

### üìå Notes

- These API endpoints are **separate** from the MVC views rendered by `TodosController.cs`.
- The API controller returns `JSON` and follows RESTful conventions.
- This setup allows the app to support both web frontend views and external API consumers.

 ### Known Limitations / Challenges
 - No user authentication or authorization (for simplicity)
 - No pagination or filtering
 - SQLite is used for quick setup; not ideal for production
 - No client-side interactivity or JS enhancements
   
### üìå Final Notes
This project was built in under 4 hours as part of a coding challenge.
Focus was placed on code clarity, simplicity, and functionality ‚Äî not completeness or complexity.
